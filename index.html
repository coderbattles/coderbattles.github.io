  <b>What is CoderBattles?</b>
  <hr/>
  CoderBattles is a platform where developers are given programming tasks, shown how to
  complete them the <b>right way</b> and rewarded when they do.

    <b>Description</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Create a RESTful API using NodeJS and MongoDB and host it on Heroku.
      This API will let users register.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are expected to think about the best way to implement the API so that users can perform
      the most basic thing described above. After making your submission, you'll get a code review on
      how to improve your code and make it better. A week after your review, your code will be checked
      again and based on implementation of the feedback given to all users, the winner will be chosen.

      <b>How can I trust you?</b></div>
      <div>
        We believe in the growth of the African Developers and Tech community and we want
        to contribute to that growth. The one way we can do that is through 
        providing valuable feedback and helping developers use best practices.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div>
      <b>Is there an online community?</b></div>
      <div>
        Yasss! Why wouldn't there be? Our believe is in the growth of the Tech <b>community</b>.
        Communities are built on trust, shared interests and solid communication. Emails and fancy
        websites can't give us that so we created a slack community and you are free to be a part of it.
        Communicate with other coders (and us) without the ugly emails.
        <a href="https://goo.gl/seYsuh">Join now!</a>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div>
      <b>Do I need to pay to join the community on slack?</b></div>
      <div>
        No! It's absolutely free and will always be. So
        <a href="https://goo.gl/seYsuh">Join now!</a>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>How often does this occur?</b></div>
      <div>
        We don't know yet. This is the first CoderBattles tournament.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>What happens when I win?</b></div>
      <div>
        If we find your submission to be the best and you are very
        responsive to feedback, we will communicate with you via slack.
        After awarding you the prize money, your fullname, repository URL, Heroku URL and
        any social account of yours (optional)
        will be put up on this website, permanently unless you decide to have it removed.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>When will the winner be decided?</b></div>
      <div>
        Going through the submissions is going to take some time because we need to be sure
        that we are giving the best possible feedback and helping you grow. The winner will be
        decided after the due date for submission (November 19, 2017 at 10:00 pm WAT) has passed
        and a week of feedback implementation has elapsed.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>Why should I enter the competition?</b></div>
      <div>
        You've been looking to get quality feeback on your code and
        you love to contribute to Open-Source. Don't ya?
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>Will the prize always be this amount?</b></div>
      <div>
        Absolutely not! If enough people show interest in this, the next tournament could go
        for higher.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>How do we know that the winner really is the best?</b></div>
      <div>
        We are an open community and we actually want to help grow the African tech community
        and unjustly picking winners isn't going to do that, let us know if you find an application
        to be unjustly chosen as the best by <a href="https://goo.gl/seYsuh">joining the slack channel</a> and posting a message, detailing
        your concerns.
      </div>
