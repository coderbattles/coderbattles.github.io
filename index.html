    <b>Description</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Create a web application using PHP and MYSQL (without any frameworks).
      This web application will let users register, login, make posts and (un)follow other users.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a user "follows" another user, they see the posts of the user they follow in addition
      to the ones they themselves create.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are expected to have a <b>Registration Page</b>, <b>Login Page</b>, <b>Users Page</b>
      and <b>Posts Page</b>. The <b>USERS</b> page will provide an interface for users to see all
      other users registered on the application (except themselves). From that interface,
      they can "follow" and "unfollow" other users. The <b>POSTS</b> page will provide the interface
      that lets any logged in user view "posts" of other users they follow, including their posts.
      These posts will be ordered based on the time they were created, from newer (top) to older (bottom).
      <br/>
      You are expected to write tests, collect coverage (Travis) and put a coverage badge in your README and
      you are to host your project on Heroku and provide the link in your repo. Make sure to write good commits
      and push to your repo regularily.
      <br/>

      <b>How can I trust you?</b></div>
      <div>
        We believe in the growth of the African Developers and Tech community and we want
        to contribute to that growth. The one way we can do that is through competitive
        programming and Open-Source.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div>
      <b>Is there an online community?</b></div>
      <div>
        Yasss! Why wouldn't there be? Our believe is in the growth of the Tech <b>community</b>.
        Communities are built on trust, shared interests and solid communication. Emails and fancy
        websites can't give us that so we created a slack community and you are free to be a part of it.
        Communicate with other coders (and us) without the ugly emails.
        <a href="https://goo.gl/seYsuh">Join now!</a>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div>
      <b>Do I need to pay to join the community on slack?</b></div>
      <div>
        No! It's absolutely free and will always be. So
        <a href="https://goo.gl/seYsuh">Join now!</a>
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>What happens if I pay the fee and decide to discontinue?</b></div>
      <div>The entrance fee is non-refundable.</div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>How often does this occur?</b></div>
      <div>
        We don't know yet. This is the first CoderBattles tournament.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>What happens when I win?</b></div>
      <div>
        If we find your submission to be the best, we will communicate with you via slack.
        After awarding you the prize money, your fullname, repository URL, Heroku URL and
        any social account of yours (optional)
        will be put up on this website, permanently unless you decide to have it removed.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>When will the winner be decided?</b></div>
      <div>
        Going through the submissions is going to take some time because we need to be sure
        that we are supporting the best talent and helping them grow. The winner will be
        decided a week after the due date for submission (November 19, 2017 at 10:00 pm WAT).
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>Why should I enter the competition?</b></div>
      <div>
        You love to compete and contribute to Open-Source. Don't ya?
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>Will the prize always be this amount?</b></div>
      <div>
        Absolutely not! If enough people show interest in this, the next tournament could go
        for higher.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <div><b>How do we know that the winner really is the best?</b></div>
      <div>
        We are an open community and we actually want to help grow the African tech community
        and unjustly picking winners isn't going to do that, let us know if you find an application
        to be unjustly chosen as the best by <a href="https://goo.gl/seYsuh">joining our slack channel</a> and posting a message, detailing
        your concerns.
      </div>
